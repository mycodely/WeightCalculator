# WeightCalculator
Positive/Negative weight calculator based on time.







<h1 align="center"> Project Weight Calculator</h1>

The program can calculate the weight gain or loss based on a weekly coefficient. By inputting three parameters(ActualWeight, Coefficient, ObjectiveWeight), it can estimate the time required to reach your target weight.

As my first project, I wanted to create something useful for my friends, family, and myself. Inspired by my interest in fitness and health, I came across this website https://www.rccc.eu/nutri/PI.html, and I wanted to create something similar.

## :hammer:project functionalities

- `F1`: The difference between initial weight and goal weight
- `F2`: Record your weight each week and update it
- `F3`: Estimate the time required based on the rate at which you're losing/gaining weight
